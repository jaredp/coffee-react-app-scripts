## Thanks

I looked to https://github.com/jimleuk/react-coffee-scripts for ideas.  The big differences between this repo and is this one is a few patches on top of facebook/create-react-app, whereas he copy+pasted code into his.  *Theoretically*, that makes this one easier to keep up to date with the official CRA, because we can git merge upstream.  Theoretically.
